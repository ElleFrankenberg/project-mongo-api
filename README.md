# Mongo API Project

The assignment for this week was to use a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

This week i only hade time to do the blue level.
It also took me a while to deploy the database. It was not entirely clear to me that I needed to create a .env file and put the string there. But I got really good help with it in the help channel.
